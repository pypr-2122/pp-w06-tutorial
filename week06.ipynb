    "    - We need to make a map of the city.\n",
    "    - Anyone consulting the map should be able to easily choose a post office to walk to.\n",

    "\n",
    "- What **data** do I have? What object **types** are best suited to store/handle which data?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We have the locations of the $n$ post offices on a map (their $(x, y)$ coordinates).\n",
    "    - We know the size and shape of the map (a $5\\times 5$km square).\n",
    "    - We know that all the roads are laid out in a grid, which means that the shortest walking distance from one point to another can be calculated using the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) metric. Numpy has the `np.linalg.norm()` function to help us calculate this, so it may be a good idea to use Numpy arrays to store the coordinate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What should the rough **structure** of the algorithm be? What essential techniques are needed â€“ loops/decisions, for/while...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - One way to produce the map could be to simulate lots of residents at random places in the city, and to find the nearest post office for all of them. We could indicate the nearest post office for each simulated resident with a different colour. (Other algorithms do exist to separate the space into [Voronoi cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram), but here we choose an approximation/simulation approach.)\n",
    "    - We will need to generate random $(x, y)$ coordinates for all the residents -- `np.random` can help with that.\n",
    "    - We will need to calculate Manhattan distances between points -- again, `np.linalg.norm()` will help. We can loop over each resident and each post office to get all the possible distances.\n",
    "    - We will need to find the closest post office for each resident -- `np.argmin()` can find the index of the smallest value in an array. We can use it to find which post office corresponds to the shortest distance for each resident.\n",
    "    - We will need to display a map -- `matplotlib` will be useful. We'll need to find a way to pick $n$ different colours to draw each cluster of points -- we'll probably have to loop over the post offices to do this.\n",
